<h1>Chapter 2:&nbsp;Getting ebooks onto your device</h1>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;In this chapter, we will discuss the process of downloading your purchased ebooks and copying them to one of devices that you may own. &nbsp; We will cover the &quot;Send to&quot; opens (Dropbox, Google Drive, and Kindle) later in the chapter. &nbsp;But first, the basics! &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;First, to locate your ebooks, log into your&nbsp;oreilly.com account by going here -&nbsp;<br />
<a data-original-title="" href="http://members.oreilly.com" title="">http://members.oreilly.com</a>&nbsp;then once logged in, click on the &quot;Your Products&quot; tab. &nbsp;Once there, click on ebooks on the right side of the page to filter your products to only see ebooks.<br />
Then click on the title of of the ebook you want to download to reveal the download buttons.</p>

<p><img alt="Alt Text" class="iformatspng" src="Formats.png" />&nbsp; When you click on the title of the ebook, the download buttons are revealed.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Alt Text" class="isend_to_optionsjpg" src="send_to_options.jpg" />&nbsp; When you click on Send Ebook, you are presented with several &quot;send to&quot; options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Alt Text" class="iepub_optionsjpg" src="epub_options.jpg" />&nbsp; On the individual format buttons, you will have a few options to either download or send the file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Alt Text" class="imobi_download_buttonpng" src="mobi_download_button.png" />&nbsp; The &quot;mobi&quot; button will also have a Send to Kindle option (if you've set it up), since that is the native Kindle format.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Laptop or desktop computer &mdash; Get either the ePub or PDF. *</li>

<h1>Laptop or desktop computer</h1>

<p>For the best experience reading your ebook on a computer, we recommend using&nbsp;the PDF format in Adobe Reader. &nbsp;Adobe Reader is our recommended PDF reader and can be downloaded for free from here - http://get.adobe.com/reader.</p>

<p>Another option is to use the ePub format in Adobe Digital Editions, which is also a free download from here -&nbsp;<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions/download.html</span></p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To open the PDF in Adobe Reader, you usually just have to double-click on it. &nbsp;Another way is to right-click on the file and choose &quot;Open With&quot; from the pop-up menu and choose Adobe Reader.</span></p>

<p>It's the same with an ePub in Adobe Digital Editions, except for choosing that from the Open With command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<section data-type="sect2">
<h1>iPad, iPhone, iPod touch</h1>

<p>The best experience reading an ebook on the iPad, iPhone or iPod is by using the included app called iBooks. &nbsp; iBooks works best with the ePub format of the ebook, although you can use the PDF. &nbsp;(for more info, see &quot;Reflowable Vs Fixed Layout Ebooks&quot;</p>

<p>There are a few ways to get your ePub or PDF file into iBooks on your device. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Logging into your oreilly.com account and downloading it directly</strong><br />
	The easiest way to get the ebook onto you device is to log directly into your oreilly.com account and download the ePub or PDF. &nbsp; (If you are on a iPhone or iPod, you might want to try our mobile account page - http://oreilly.com/e ). &nbsp;Once the ePub file downloads into the browser, the browser will show the file with a box that says &quot;Open in iBooks&quot;. &nbsp;Just tap on that, and the ePub is copied to iBooks. &nbsp;When you download the PDF, it downloads into the Safari browser&nbsp;(you could read it there, but it's not a very good experience). &nbsp;Once it's loaded, tap the screen once and in the upper right corner a box will pop up that says &quot;Open in iBooks&quot;. &nbsp;You have to tap it quickly as it goes away after a couple of seconds.</li>
	<li><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Plugging your device into your computer and syncing with iTunes</span></strong><br />
	Another way is to download the ebook to your computer, and then drag it into the iTunes icon or the iTunes library window. &nbsp;iTunes automatically puts it into the Books library. &nbsp;Plug your device in and once iTunes recognizes it, you can drag the ebook from the Books library onto the iPad's name&nbsp;in the upper right part of the window, which will expand as you drag over it.

	<br />
	You can also click on the iPad once it shows up, and choose Sync at the bottom of the window.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Using Dropbox to send the file to your device and opening it from the Dropbox app.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	You can also use the Sent to Dropbox feature in your oreilly.com account to send your ebook to your Dropbox account. &nbsp; When you have the Dropbox app installed on your device, the ebook will show up there. &nbsp; Once you tap on the file name, it will download it to your device's Dropbox, but with the ePub format it will say &quot;Unable to view file&quot;. &nbsp;Just tap the box with an arrow pointing down into it (&quot;Open In&quot;) and choose iBooks from the menu that appears.</span>
	<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="idropboxphotojpg" src="Dropboxphoto.jpg" /> <figcaption>Tap the box in the lower right to open in iBooks</figcaption></figure>
	</li>

<h1>Kindle</h1>

<p>There are several methods for getting your ebook from oreilly.com onto your Kindle device. &nbsp; &nbsp;The easiest option, once set up, is our Send To Kindle feature in your oreilly.com account. &nbsp; This page has simple instructions for getting that service set up -&nbsp;<br />
<a data-original-title="" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/kindle.do" title="">http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/kindle.do</a>&nbsp;<br />
The most common problem people have when setting that up is they forget to put the kindle@oreilly.com email address in the Approved Personal Document E-mail List under your Personal Document Settings in your Amazon.com account.</p>

<p>If your Kindle has a web browser on it, you can log directly into your oreilly.com account and download the mobi file to your Kindle. &nbsp; This URL is for the mobile account system, which might be easier to view - oreilly.com/e&nbsp;<br />
Once you log in, just click on the mobi format button to download the ebook.</p>

<p>&quot;Sideloading&quot; is another way to get an ebook onto your Kindle device. &nbsp;Sideloading refers to plugging your Kindle into your computer, and copying the mobi file that you have downloaded to your computer to the Documents folder of your Kindle. &nbsp;Here are instruction for that:</p>

<p><b>Transfer by connecting your Kindle to your computer:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>Download the MOBI format of your ebook&nbsp;to your computer.</li>
	<li>Connect your Kindle to the computer using the USB/charging cable provided.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop the file to your Kindle's &quot;documents&quot; folder</li>
	<li>When done, eject the Kindle&rsquo;s disk icon (right-click on the icon and choose &ldquo;Eject.&rdquo;). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section data-type="sect4">
<h1>Android</h1>

<p>On Android phones, you&rsquo;ll want to either download the ePub or APk directly on to the phone from your oreilly.com account.&nbsp;Log into your account on <a href="http://oreilly.com/"><span style="color: #001bee">oreilly.com</span></a> and then click on the &quot;your products&quot; tab. On the &quot;eBooks&quot; tab, click on the title you want to download to expand the selection of formats and then on the ePub or .APK button to start the download.&nbsp;I personally like to use the Aldiko reader for ePubs (if available for that title). Once downloaded, it will import into Aldiko and you will have the option to open it up there. For .APK files, they also can be downloaded directly onto your phone. (I used the &ldquo;Verify and Install&rdquo; option to install the APK file as my phone was previously set to not install files not purchased from the Android Market so you may also have to change your security settings in order to install the .APK file downloaded from our site). Items purchased from the Google Play store should be able to be opened automatically after purchase and downloading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also of course retrieve them from DropBox or Google Drive if you have those features set up and have already sent the ebooks there.</p>

<section data-type="sect5">
<h1>Nook</h1>

<p>The first time you plug in your nook to your computer, a drive will appear called &ldquo;Nook&rdquo;, this will only contain a file called MyNook Setup.html. Open that file.</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="inook_1png" src="Nook_1.png" /> <figcaption>MyNook Setup, shown on a Mac</figcaption></figure>

<p>The file will display the following page:</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to MyNOOK Setup.</strong></p>

<p>MyNOOK Setup is a one-time installation that will allow you to tranfer your personal files to your NOOK.<br />
Transferable files include, but are not limited to: photos, music, videos, EPUB,PDF and Microsoft Office files.<br />
Note: Copyright protected files are not transferable<br />
To install, go to <a data-original-title="" href="http://www.nook.com/MyNOOKSetup" title="">http://www.NOOK.com/MyNOOKSetup.</a><br />
For more information, visit <a href="http://www.nook.com/support">http://www.NOOK.com/support.</a></p>

<p><strong>Going to </strong><a href="http://www.nook.com/MyNOOKSetup">http://www.NOOK.com/MyNOOKSetup.</a> Will automatically download a DMG file called &ldquo;MyNOOKSetup.dmg.&rdquo; Open that up, and open up the file &ldquo;MyNOOK Setup.pkg&rdquo; that it contains. This will open up an installer for the software that allows you to load books on to your nook. It will ask you to agree to the terms and conditions. It takes up about 9MB of space to install.</p>

<p>Once you have the &ldquo;MyNOOK&rdquo; software installed, a drive called &ldquo;MyNook&rdquo; will appear on your computer every time you plug in the nook via USB. When you open the &ldquo;MyNook&rdquo; drive it will show some folders. &ldquo;Android&rdquo; which contains the data for any apps you have. &ldquo;B&amp;N Downloads&rdquo; which contains any media you have downloaded directly from Barnes and Noble. And &ldquo;My Files&rdquo; which contains a few folders for any media you wish to load yourself.</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="inook_2png" src="Nook_2.png" /> <figcaption>This shows the folders on a Nook.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Any books you wish to load, just drag and drop them in to the &ldquo;Books&rdquo; folder in &ldquo;My Files&rdquo;. Once you are done, eject the &ldquo;MyNOOK&rdquo; drive. Any books you loaded should appear in your library on your Nook.</p>

<p>*With older nooks you shouldn&rsquo;t even have to download the &ldquo;MyNook&rdquo; software.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you plug in the device, the &ldquo;B&amp;N Downloads&rdquo; and &ldquo;My Files&rdquo; folders should appear in a drive.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect6">
<h1>Sony Reader</h1>

<p>When you plug in the device to a computer via USB you will be prompted &ldquo;Do you want the computer to recognize this device&rdquo; and you select &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. The device display will then show that the computer has successfully recognized it.</p>

<p>The device will now show up as a drive on your computer. The default name for it is &ldquo;READER&rdquo;. On the &ldquo;READER&rdquo; drive there are the folders DCIM, Sony_Reader and tmp. Inside the Sony_Reader folder are the folders books, images and notepads.</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="isony_1png" src="Sony_1.png" /> <figcaption>This shows the folders on the Sony Reader when mounted.</figcaption></figure>

<p>You can drag and drop an ePub file in to the books folder. Once you have moved a book in to that folder, you must eject the &ldquo;READER&rdquo; drive, before you can use the device.&nbsp; And once the device is ejected, it is safe to unplug it from the USB cord.</p>

<p>One the home screen of the device, the book you just added to the device should appear with a &ldquo;new&rdquo; tag on it.</p>
</section>

<section data-type="sect7">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Calibre</strong></p>

<p>Another option is using the software Calibre to load books. This recognized almost every e-reader with the exception of newer Nooks and the iPad. You just add your books to the Calibre Library, and can add them to any device that is plugged in. If the book is an ePub and your device is a kindle, Calibre will convert it to a MOBI for you before loading.<br />

<h1>Reflowable Vs Fixed Layout Ebooks</h1>

<p>There are basically two types of ebook layouts available. Fixed&nbsp;layout&nbsp;and reflowable. &nbsp; &nbsp; PDFs are a fixed&nbsp;layout, which means the that page is exactly the same layout as in the print book and it stays that way even if you increase the size&nbsp;of the view. &nbsp; &nbsp;The ePub&nbsp;and mobi formats are reflowable, which means&nbsp;that the page layout&nbsp;scales to fit different screen and font sizes by changing page breaks and paragraph widths. &nbsp;Since&nbsp;they don't have a fixed page, when you increase the font size, the total&nbsp;number of pages increases.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Laptop or desktop computer</h1>

<p>For the best experience reading your ebook on a computer, we recommend using&nbsp;the PDF format in Adobe Reader. &nbsp;Adobe Reader is our recommended PDF reader and can be downloaded for free from here - http://get.adobe.com/reader.</p>

<p>Another option is to use the ePub format in Adobe Digital Editions, which is also a free download from here -&nbsp;<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions/download.html</span></p>

<p>To download your ebook, just go to the Your Products section of your account, and find the title you wish to download. &nbsp;Click on the title to reveal the download buttons and additional resources. &nbsp;Then, click on the format (mobi, PDF, ePub) to download the appropriate format for your reader. &nbsp;</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="iformatspng" src="Formats.png" /> <figcaption>When you click on the title of the ebook, the download buttons are revealed.</figcaption></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="isend_to_optionsjpg" src="send_to_options.jpg" /> <figcaption>When you click on Send Ebook, you are presented with several &quot;send to&quot; options.</figcaption></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="iepub_optionsjpg" src="epub_options.jpg" /> <figcaption>On the individual format buttons, you will have a few options to either download or send the file.</figcaption></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="imobi_download_buttonpng" src="mobi_download_button.png" /> <figcaption>The &quot;mobi&quot; button will also have a Send to Kindle option (if you've set it up), since that is the native Kindle format.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">To open the PDF in Adobe Reader, you usually just have to double-click on it. &nbsp;Another way is to right-click on the file and choose &quot;Open With&quot; from the pop-up menu and choose Adobe Reader.</span></p>

<p>It's the same with an ePub in Adobe Digital Editions, except for choosing that from the Open With command.</p>

<h1>iPad, iPhone, iPod touch</h1>

<p>The best experience reading an ebook on the iPad, iPhone or iPod is by using the included app called iBooks. &nbsp; iBooks works best with the ePub format of the ebook, although you can use the PDF. &nbsp;(for more info, see &quot;Reflowable Vs Fixed Layout Ebooks&quot;</p>

<p>There are a few ways to get your ePub or PDF file into iBooks on your device. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Logging into your oreilly.com account and downloading it directly</strong><br />
	The easiest way to get the ebook onto you device is to log directly into your oreilly.com account and download the ePub or PDF. &nbsp; (If you are on a iPhone or iPod, you might want to try our mobile account page - http://oreilly.com/e ). &nbsp;Once the ePub file downloads into the browser, the browser will show the file with a box that says &quot;Open in iBooks&quot;. &nbsp;Just tap on that, and the ePub is copied to iBooks. &nbsp;When you download the PDF, it downloads into the Safari browser&nbsp;(you could read it there, but it's not a very good experience). &nbsp;Once it's loaded, tap the screen once and in the upper right corner a box will pop up that says &quot;Open in iBooks&quot;. &nbsp;You have to tap it quickly as it goes away after a couple of seconds.</li>
	<li><strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Plugging your device into your computer and syncing with iTunes</span></strong><br />
	Another way is to download the ebook to your computer, and then drag it into the iTunes icon or the iTunes library window. &nbsp;iTunes automatically puts it into the Books library. &nbsp;Plug your device in and once iTunes recognizes it, you can drag the ebook from the Books library onto the iPad's name&nbsp;in the upper right part of the window, which will expand as you drag over it.

	<br />
	You can also click on the iPad once it shows up, and choose Sync at the bottom of the window.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5em;"><strong>Using Dropbox to send the file to your device and opening it from the Dropbox app.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
	You can also use the Sent to Dropbox feature in your oreilly.com account to send your ebook to your Dropbox account. &nbsp; When you have the Dropbox app installed on your device, the ebook will show up there. &nbsp; Once you tap on the file name, it will download it to your device's Dropbox, but with the ePub format it will say &quot;Unable to view file&quot;. &nbsp;Just tap the box with an arrow pointing down into it (&quot;Open In&quot;) and choose iBooks from the menu that appears.</span>
	<figure><img alt="Alt Text" class="idropboxphotojpg" src="Dropboxphoto.jpg" /> <figcaption>Tap the box in the lower right to open in iBooks</figcaption></figure>

<h1>Kindle</h1>

<p>There are several methods for getting your ebook from oreilly.com onto your Kindle device. &nbsp; &nbsp;The easiest option, once set up, is our Send To Kindle feature in your oreilly.com account. &nbsp; This page has simple instructions for getting that service set up -&nbsp;<br />
<a data-original-title="" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/kindle.do" title="">http://shop.oreilly.com/category/customer-service/kindle.do</a>&nbsp;<br />
The most common problem people have when setting that up is they forget to put the kindle@oreilly.com email address in the Approved Personal Document E-mail List under your Personal Document Settings in your Amazon.com account.</p>

<p>If your Kindle has a web browser on it, you can log directly into your oreilly.com account and download the mobi file to your Kindle. &nbsp; This URL is for the mobile account system, which might be easier to view - oreilly.com/e&nbsp;<br />
Once you log in, just click on the mobi format button to download the ebook.</p>

<p>&quot;Sideloading&quot; is another way to get an ebook onto your Kindle device. &nbsp;Sideloading refers to plugging your Kindle into your computer, and copying the mobi file that you have downloaded to your computer to the Documents folder of your Kindle. &nbsp;Here are instruction for that:</p>

<p><b>Transfer by connecting your Kindle to your computer:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>Download the MOBI format of your ebook&nbsp;to your computer.</li>
	<li>Connect your Kindle to the computer using the USB/charging cable provided.</li>
	<li>Drag and drop the file to your Kindle's &quot;documents&quot; folder</li>
	<li>When done, eject the Kindle&rsquo;s disk icon (right-click on the icon and choose &ldquo;Eject.&rdquo;). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section data-type="sect4">
<h1>Android</h1>

<p>On Android phones, you&rsquo;ll want to either download the ePub or APk directly on to the phone from your oreilly.com account.&nbsp;Log into your account on <a href="http://oreilly.com/"><span style="color: #001bee">oreilly.com</span></a> and then click on the &quot;your products&quot; tab. On the &quot;eBooks&quot; tab, click on the title you want to download to expand the selection of formats and then on the ePub or .APK button to start the download.&nbsp;I personally like to use the Aldiko reader for ePubs (if available for that title). Once downloaded, it will import into Aldiko and you will have the option to open it up there. For .APK files, they also can be downloaded directly onto your phone. (I used the &ldquo;Verify and Install&rdquo; option to install the APK file as my phone was previously set to not install files not purchased from the Android Market so you may also have to change your security settings in order to install the .APK file downloaded from our site). Items purchased from the Google Play store should be able to be opened automatically after purchase and downloading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also of course retrieve them from DropBox or Google Drive if you have those features set up and have already sent the ebooks there.</p>

<h1>Reflowable Vs Fixed Layout Ebooks</h1>

<p>There are basically two types of ebook layouts available. Fixed&nbsp;layout&nbsp;and reflowable. &nbsp; &nbsp; PDFs are a fixed&nbsp;layout, which means the that page is exactly the same layout as in the print book and it stays that way even if you increase the size&nbsp;of the view. &nbsp; &nbsp;The ePub&nbsp;and mobi formats are reflowable, which means&nbsp;that the page layout&nbsp;scales to fit different screen and font sizes by changing page breaks and paragraph widths. &nbsp;Since&nbsp;they don't have a fixed page, when you increase the font size, the total&nbsp;number of pages increases.&nbsp;</p>
